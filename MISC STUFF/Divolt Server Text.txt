#### What is Divolt? 
 
Divolt is a self-hosted Discord alternative ran by pirates, for pirates. Just like Discord it consists of multiple communities you can be a part of, including FMHY. The chat is also bridged to our private Discord, meaning both communities can communicate with one another easily.

#### Things to Note
 
* Divolt is a self-hosted version of Revolt, meaning you need to make an account on Divolt, even if you already have one on Revolt. 
 
* During signup you can use a fake email, but it will only load with real domains like .gmail.
 
* The emoji picker can be turned on via Settings > Experiments > Custom Emoji.
 
* If you'd like to join Discord you must be active in our community, or a developer / contributor to one of the projects we have posted in the wiki. 
 
* If the page won't load, try clearing your cache, a different browser, disabling ublock or using incognito.
